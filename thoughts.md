# Project Thoughts

## Avoiding Over-Engineering

This project was intentionally designed with simplicity and maintainability in mind. The following principles guided the implementation:

- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** Only features required by the current scope were implemented. No speculative abstractions or unnecessary layers were added.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Code and architecture were kept as straightforward as possible. No service providers, repositories, or event-driven patterns unless justified by real complexity.
- **Leverage Framework Conventions:** Laravel's built-in features (Eloquent, validation, authentication, resource responses) were used directly to minimize boilerplate and maximize clarity.
- **Test What Matters:** Tests focus on business logic and API contracts, not on implementation details or exhaustive edge cases that are unlikely in the current scope.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only essential packages and tools are included, reducing maintenance and onboarding friction.

## Areas for Improvement & Scalability

If this application were to grow in complexity or user base, the following areas could be revisited and improved:

### 1. **Domain Layer & Service Abstractions**
- Introduce service interfaces and repository patterns for better separation of concerns and easier testing/mocking.
- Consider CQRS or event sourcing if business logic becomes more complex.

### 2. **Validation & Error Handling**
- Centralize error handling and validation logic for consistency across APIs.
- Use custom exception handlers for more granular error responses.

### 3. **API Versioning & Documentation**
- Adopt OpenAPI/Swagger for automated API documentation.
- Plan for versioned APIs as breaking changes become necessary.

### 4. **Performance & Caching**
- Add caching for product lists and wishlist counts if read traffic increases.

### 5. **Security & Authentication**
- Consider OAuth or JWT for stateless APIs or third-party integrations.
- Add rate limiting and monitoring for abuse prevention.

### 6. **Testing**
- Expand test coverage to include more edge cases and integration tests.

### 7. **Monitoring & Observability**
- Integrate logging, error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag), and performance monitoring.
- Add health checks and alerting for production readiness.

## Summary

This project is intentionally lean, but the codebase is structured to allow for future growth. The above areas provide a roadmap for scaling and hardening the application as requirements evolve.
